## Estimation and forecasting of multivariate high frequency volatility models: application to a leveraged risk-parity portfolio 

The purpose of the thesis was to study a selection of bivariate high frequency volatility models and compare them using Hansens model confidence set. A selection of the best volatility models was then used in a portfolio setup with surprising results. 

The code for my master thesis. The code will be fractioned into small sniplets corresponding to different subsections of my thesis. This will provide a better overview and make things easier. The data cleaning code was only used once for time efficiency, and thus I stored the cleaned data as .Rdata of the assets that I'm working with.
