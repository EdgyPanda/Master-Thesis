# Master thesis

The code for my master thesis. The code will be fractioned into small sniplets corresponding to different subsections of my thesis. This will provide a better overview and make things easier. The data cleaning code was only used once for time efficiency, and thus I stored the cleaned data as .Rdata of the assets that I'm working with.
